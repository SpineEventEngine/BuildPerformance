# BuildPerformance

This repository contains a set of Protobuf model definitions.

Unlike many other [Spine examples](https://github.com/spine-examples), this repo does not contain
Java or any other implementations. Instead, it focuses on the model definitions, providing
a sizable amount of various Proto definitions.

Using the definitions in this repo, we can test performance of our build tools, comparing it to
the past performance.
